## **Prerequisite** <a name="prerequisite"></a>
To be able to follow up with this article, you must have the following setup on your local environment

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## **What is Nuxt** <a name="what-is-nuxt"></a>
Nuxt.js is a free and open-source web application framework based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack, and Babel.js. Find out more [here](https://nuxtjs.org).

## **What is Chakra UI Vue** <a name="what-is-chakra-ui"></a>
Chakra UI Vue gives you a set of accessible and composable Vue components that you can use to build your favorite applications and sites. Find out more [here](https://vue.chakra-ui.com).

## **Setup Nuxt App** <a name="setup-nuxt-app"></a>
There are two ways of setting up a Nuxt application, either by [starting from scratch](#starting-from-scratch) or using the [create-nuxt-app](#using-create-nuxt-app).

### **Using Create-Nuxt-App** <a name="using-create-nuxt-app"></a>

The create-nuxt-app is a quick and easy way to get started using nuxt. It creates a boilerplate app that is customizable to the user needs.

You can install by using `npx` or `yarn`


```
npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>
```

Where `<project-name>` in the above command is the name of the project you want to create.

> Note: The npx command comes bundled with npm versions 5.2.0 and above, if you use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), you can run `yarn create nuxt-app <project-name>` on your terminal.


The above command would prompt you with some questions, and configurations you want for the project. See example in the gif below

![create-nuxt-app demo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d9hx9vbdzf2v46vi3fyj.gif)


Once you've followed through with the prompts, and the installation is finished, navigate to the project directory on your code editor, open a terminal and run `npm run dev`, or `yarn dev` to start the application.

Once started, click on the generated link and open in the browser, you should see the same as the example in the image below.

And that's it, you've been able to create a Nuxt application, bootstrapped with Chakra UI Vue, you can go ahead to build out your application using Chakra UI Vue. Find out more about the create-nuxt-app setup [here](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app).

### **Starting from Scratch** <a name="starting-from-scratch"></a>
If you have an already existing nuxt project, you can skip to [Setting Up Chakra UI](#setting-up-chakra-ui), but if you want to set up a nuxt project from scratch, you can follow the next steps below


- **Setting up Nuxt** <a name="setting-up-nuxt"></a>

To setup Nuxt from scratch, create a project folder on your system and open the folder in your code editor.

The next step is to initialize a package.json file by running the command below

```
npm init -y
```

The next step is to install the nuxt dependency by running the command below

```
npm install --save nuxt
```

Then add the scripts to the package.json

```json
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "nuxt",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "start": "nuxt start"
  }
```
- Create a pages directory, in the root of the project, and create an index.vue file there.

Add the code below to the index.vue file

```html
<template>
  <p>Hello</p>
</template>
```

To run the app, run `npm run dev` on your terminal.

 - **Setting up Chakra UI** <a name="setting-up-chakra-ui"></a>

Install chakra dependencies
```
npm install @chakra-ui/nuxt @nuxtjs/emotion
```

- Create `nuxt.config` file in the root of the project and add the configuration below
```js
export default {
  mode: "universal",
  head: {
    title: "Chakra UI Vue Starter",
    meta: [
      { charset: "utf-8" },
      { name: "viewport", content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" },
      {
        hid: "description",
        name: "description",
        content: "Chakra UI Vue integration with Nuxt starter",
      },
    ],
    link: [{ rel: "icon", type: "image/x-icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
  },

  modules: [
    "@chakra-ui/nuxt", // register the chakra nuxt package
    "@nuxtjs/emotion", // register the emotion package which is being used by chakra-ui-vue
  ],
};
```
> **Note:** If you're using a pre-existing nuxt app, and already have a `nuxt.config.js` file, just add the `@chakra-ui/nuxt` and `@nuxtjs/emotion` to the modules section of the `nuxt.config.js` file.

Edit the index.vue file, and add the code below. 

```vue
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <CBox d="flex" w="100vw" h="100vh" flex-dir="column" justify-content="center">
      <CHeading textAlign="center" mb="4">⚡️ Hello chakra-ui/vue</CHeading>
      <CFlex justify="center" direction="column" align="center">
        <CButton left-icon="info" variant-color="blue" @click="showToast">Show Toast</CButton>
      </CFlex>
    </CBox>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="js">
import {
  CBox,
  CButton,
  CFlex,
  CHeading,
} from '@chakra-ui/vue'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    CBox,
    CButton,
    CFlex,
    CHeading,
  },
  methods: {
    showToast () {
      this.$toast({
        title: 'Account created.',
        description: "We've created your account for you.",
        status: 'success',
        duration: 10000,
        isClosable: true
      })
    }
  }
}
</script>
```


- Create `layouts` directory and a `default.vue` file, and add the code below

```vue
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <CThemeProvider>
      <CColorModeProvider>
        <CBox font-family="body" as="main">
          <CReset/>
          <Nuxt/>
        </CBox>
      </CColorModeProvider>
    </CThemeProvider>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import {
  CThemeProvider,
  CColorModeProvider,
  CReset,
  CBox
} from "@chakra-ui/vue";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    CThemeProvider,
    CColorModeProvider,
    CReset,
    CBox
  }
};
</script>

```
