### React Navigation Dependencies & Setup

Install the dependencies below

---

The dependency below is the core dependencie of react navigation

- Stack Navigation
- Tab navigation
- Drawer navigation

```
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/drawer
```

These dependencies below are the dependency relied upon for animations and ...

```
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

In the root file of our app, in this case the `App.js` file, we would setup our react navigation there.

```js
import React from "react";
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";

export default function App() {
  return <NavigationContainer>{/* Navigation here */}</NavigationContainer>;
}
```

### Screens setup

I'd be setting up 3 screens for the purpose of this demo, feel free to just copy them.

So I'd set them up in a screens directory. So create a screens directory `src/screens` and add the components below

Home Screen
```js
// src/screens/Home.jsx
import React from "react";
import { View, Button, Text, StyleSheet } from "react-native";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.center}>
      <Text>This is the home screen</Text>
      <Button title="Go to About Screen" />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  center: {
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  },
});

export default Home;
```

About Screen
```js
// src/screens/About.jsx
import React from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet, Text } from "react-native";

const About = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.center}>
      <Text>This is the about screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  center: {
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  },
});

export default About;
```

Contact Screen
```js
// src/screens/Contact.jsx
import React from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet, Text } from "react-native";

const Contact = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.center}>
      <Text>This is the contact screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  center: {
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  },
});

export default Contact;
```

- Stack Navigation
- Tab Navigation
- Drawer Navigation

### Stack Navigation

The stack navigation provides a way for your react native apps to transition between screens by using a stack, so that means the screens are stacked on each other. For example, if you navigate from Login to Signup, the Signup screen is stacked on top of the login screen, and if you navigate back, the signup screen is then popped off the stack.

### Tab Navigation

### Drawer Navigation

### Combining NAvigations
