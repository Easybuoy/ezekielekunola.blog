Understanding the package.json file is important as a Javascript developer, because

## **What is a package.json file**

A package.json file is a file that exists in the root of a project and it holds metadata relevant to the project and is mostly used for managing dependencies of the project, as well as scripts.

## Why is the package.json file needed

## **Creating a `package.json` file**

There are two ways of creating/generating a `package.json` file.

- **Npm or Yarn**

  To create the package.json file with **npm**, run `npm init` on your terminal. 

  > Note: To use this method, you need to have [Node]() installed on your system.

  To create the package.json file with **yarn**, run `yarn init` on your terminal.

  > Note: To use the yarn method, you need to have [Node]() and [Yarn]() installed on your system.

  After running the command, it should ask for some information about the project and generate a `package.json` file in the root of your project. The generated file should look like the example below.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "storemanager",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "directories": {
      "test": "test"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
  }
  ```

- **Manually**

  To create file manually, create a `package.json` file manually in the root of the project, and add an empty object with the required properties, which are name and version.
  It should look like the example below.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "storemanager",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```

## **Properties of a package.json file**

### name

The name property is a required field in the `package.json` file, it represents the name of the project. There are rules you need to follow when specifying a name for your project in the package.json file.

- must be lowercase
- must be one word
- can contain hyphens and unserscores
- should not start with underscore(\_) or dot(.)

```json
  "name": "storemanager"
```

### version

The version is also a required field in the `package.json` file. The property denotes the current version of the module for the project.
The rule required for the version field is that it needs to follow the [semantic versioning guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) e.g 1.0.2

```json
  "version": "1.0.0"
```

### description

The description property is used in describing and providing more information about the project.

```json
  "description": "Storemanager is a project that..."
```

### engines

### dependencies

### devdependencies

### scripts

### private

### main

The main property serves as the entry point of your application and should point to the file that serves as the entry point to your application.

```json
  "main": "app.js"
```

### private

### license

This property denotes the type of license that's being used by the project

```json
"license": "MIT"
```

### author

This property denotes the creator/owner of the project

```json
"author": "Ezekiel Ekunola"
```

### repository

### browsersList
