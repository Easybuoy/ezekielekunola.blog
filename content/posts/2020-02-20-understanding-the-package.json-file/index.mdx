Understanding the package.json file is important as a Javascript developer, because

## **What is a package.json file**

A package.json file is a file that exists in the root of a project and it holds metadata relevant to the project and is mostly used for managing dependencies of the project, as well as scripts.

## Why is the package.json file needed

## **Creating a `package.json` file**

There are two ways of creating/generating a `package.json` file.

- **Npm or Yarn**

  To create the package.json file with **npm**, run `npm init` on your terminal.

  > To use this method, you need to have [Node]() installed on your system.

  To create the package.json file with **yarn**, run `yarn init` on your terminal.

  > To use the yarn method, you need to have [Node]() and [Yarn]() installed on your system.

  After running the command, it should ask for some information about the project and generate a `package.json` file in the root of your project. The generated file should look like the example below.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "storemanager",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "directories": {
      "test": "test"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
  }
  ```

- **Manually**

  To create file manually, create a `package.json` file manually in the root of the project, and add an empty object with the required properties, which are name and version.
  It should look like the example below.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "storemanager",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```

## **Properties of a package.json file**

### name

The name property is a required field in the `package.json` file, it represents the name of the project. There are rules you need to follow when specifying a name for your project in the package.json file.

- must be lowercase
- must be one word
- can contain hyphens and unserscores
- should not start with underscore(\_) or dot(.)

```json
  "name": "storemanager"
```

### version

The version is also a required field in the `package.json` file. The property denotes the current version of the module for the project.
The rule required for the version field is that it needs to follow the [semantic versioning guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) e.g 1.0.2

```json
  "version": "1.0.0"
```

### description

The description property is used in describing and providing more information about the project.

```json
  "description": "Storemanager is a project that..."
```

### engines

The engines property is an object of key/value pairs which is used to denote/specify the version of the libraries and runtimes on which the application should run on.

```json
 "engines": {
    "npm": "6.10.0",
    "node": "10.14.1"
  }
```

### dependencies

The dependencies property denotes the list of the required modules/packages for your application to function. After installing a dependency, it is added to the dependencies list.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
  "cors": "^2.8.5",
  "dotenv": "^6.1.0",
  "express": "^4.16.4",
}
```

To install a dependency, run **`npm i package`** or **`npm install package`** on your terminal. Where package is the name of the package you are trying to install.

For example, to install **axios** dependency, run **`npm install axios`** on your terminal.

### devDependencies

The devDependencies property denotes the list of modules/packages that are not required for your application to function. They are also known as development dependencies.

```json
 "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^4.19.1",
    "mocha": "^6.2.0",
    "nodemon": "^1.19.1",
  }
```

To install a devDependency, run **`npm i package --save-dev`** or **`npm install package -D`** on your terminal. Where package is the name of the package you are trying to install.

For example, to install **chai** devDependency, run **`npm install chai --save-dev`** on your terminal.

### scripts

The script property takes an object of key/value pairs. Each script can be used in performing different sets of tasks, like building, testing, linting the application.
You can run the scripts by running **`npm run scriptname`**, or **`yarn scriptname`** on the terminal.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index",
    "dev": "nodemon index",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint ./server",
  }
```

For example, to run the **dev** script in the example above, run **`npm run dev`** or **`yarn dev`** on your terminal.

### main

The main property serves as the entry point of your application and should point to the file that serves as the entry point to your application.

```json
  "main": "app.js"
```

### homepage

The homepage property is used to set the landing page for the application/package.

```json
 "homepage": "https://github.com/Easybuoy/package.json-mastery#readme",
```

### private

The private property is false by default, but can be set to true to prevent the application/package to be published.

```json
  "private": true
```

### license

This property denotes the type of license that's being used by the project

```json
"license": "MIT"
```

### author

This property denotes the creator/owner of the project

```json
"author": "Ezekiel Ekunola"
```

### repository

The repository keyword is an object of key/value pairs which is used to set the version control system being used to manage the application. You can specify the type of version control being used,
the url to the repository, as well as an optional directory within the repository.

```json
"repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/Easybuoy/package.json-mastery.git"
  }
```

### bugs

The bugs property is used to point to the issues page of the repository for the application or anyplace the issue can be reported.

```json
 "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/Easybuoy/package.json-mastery/issues"
  }
```

## Conclusion

> Throughout the course of this article, I made use of `npm` commands for showing examples of how to do stuffs, if you make use of `yarn` check [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/) for the `yarn cli` commands.
