Early this year, I read [Prosper's 2018 year review](https://medium.com/@unicodeveloper/2018-in-review-shattering-expectations-9418f2d720cc) and it inspired me to do and accomplish alot, and is also the reason I've decided to also write my year review as well.

Today is the last day of 2019 ...
2019 has been a year of ups and downs for me, mostly ups üòÅ.
The first quarter of 2019 was not so pleasant for me, but I was able to bounce back, turn things around and have a great year.
2019 has been a great year for me, but it did not start with roses

At the beginning of the year, I did not plan to do some of the things I did, my only plan/goal was to become a better developer, all the other things like writing, mentoring came along
from people around me pushing me to greatness.
I think I did well in 2019, i need to be more consistent with my writing 

## Work & Personal Projects üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª

### Work

- [Andela](http://andela.com): At the beginning of the year, I was working for [Andela](http://andela.com), and it was a great experience for me, I met lots of fantastic people with great minds, and people
  who pushed me to give my very best. On September 17, however, Andela laid off about 400 engineers, sadly I was among them (read more [here](https://andela.com/insights/the-future-of-andela)).
  Andela invested alot in me, and I'd be foerever grateful for the experience and the support that Andela showed, even after we were laid off.

  I started the year working for Andela, but on September, I was part of the people Andela laid off ....

  I met and connected with lots of great and amazing people this year from around the world.

  My responsibilities includes ....

## Writing ‚úçüèæ

I started writing this year, and I started writing on my experiences with tools and technologies as well as teaching on how to ...
On ... My first ever article was on [Deploying React app from Github to Netlify](), it has been a way of giving back to the community I started writing in July and have written a total of 10 articles this year, including this one. 

Writing has not exactly been easy for me, I was not able to write as much this year as I would have loved to. I'm still trying to figure out the best way that works for me, what topics to write on, but I believe with time
I want to give special shoutouts to [Johnson](https://dev.to/ogwurujohnson) and [Chinedu](https://dev.to/nedsoft) for their support and motivation, and for helping me find bugs in my articles ü§™.

I've gotten some good feedback from people as to how my articles helped them one way or another, which just motivates me to want to do more

### Mentorship

Mentored in the [Andela DevCTraining](https://devctraining.andela.com) program

### Events

This year, I was only able to attend the [concatenate](https://www.concatenate.dev) and [unstack](https://unstack.dev) event held in Lagos, Nigeria. I learnt alot at the events about GraphQL, 
The events were truly an awesome experience.

At the events I learned alot from design, communication, accessibility,...., I was also able to network and connect with other people in the tech industry, and also find out the interesting things they've been building and developing.
