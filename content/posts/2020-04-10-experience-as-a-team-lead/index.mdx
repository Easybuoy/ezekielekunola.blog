November 2019 I started working as a Technical Team Lead at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com). 6 months down the line I want to write about my experiences and the lessons learned along the way.

The Technical Team Lead position entailed managing a cross-functional diverse team remotely from various backgrounds around the world, leading standup meetings, delivering one-on-one daily feedback and code reviews, and much more.

During my time as a Technical Team Lead, I led a team of 6 engineers that built a workout tracker product within 2 months called [Trackdrills](https://trackdrills.com). We made use of agile methodologies, carrying out Customer, User, and Technical research before building out the product.

The second stage was to guide another team of 6 through the process of learning Data structures and Algorithms.

# **Lessons Learned**
- **Leading by example**
Attending and hosting team meetings on time and on schedule, always professional during team meetings, by taking responsibility and apologize when I'm late to team meetings

- **Communication**
Communication is key and very integral when working generally, I learned to communicate on time, communicate changes to schedule, or meeting times on time... I was also able to manage expectations by always communicating with the stakeholders of the projects frequently.

- **Preparation is key**
I've learned to always prepare to go into meetings, no matter what the meeting is about, always have an overview of the goal of the meetings, plan an agender for the meeting and also questions that can be asked and overall. It helps in getting value out of the meeting

- **Giving & Receiving Feedback**
The team lead position required giving feedback to students weekly, I learned to give ASK (Actionable, Specific and Kind) feedback and to highlight what the students did well that week and also what they could improve on. The students also provided feedback for their team leads weekly as well, so I've had to reflect on their feedback and make improvements where needed based on their feedback.

- **Prioritizing**
When working with deadlines, I learned to prioritize tasks by looking at the end goal and determining which tasks take priority over the other and delegating team members to work on them.

- **Patience & Empathy**
People face different challenges in life which would sometimes affect their performance at work or in general, I learned to always try to find out what's going on with people asides work and be patient with them.
Even when having though conversations, I learned to consider what the other person is going through and show empathy in my way of communicating

- **Time Management**
I learned how to schedule my day, and manage my time effectively by always planning my day ahead and sticking to the plan for the day. I was more productive and accomplished more of my goals this way.

# Conclusion
During my time working as a Technical Team Lead, I also tried working on a side project and further develop my skills. During this time I looked into Vuejs and built a [movie listing application](https://vuemovieapp.netlify.com)  using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [IMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

The past 6 months have been great, I had the chance to work with a great team in supporting the growth of students, and also to develop my skills as well.
